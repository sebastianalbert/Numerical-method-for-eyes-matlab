%{
Function that propagates a electromagnetic field in a medium for a certain length and returns
the resulting field at the length, by taking the each point in the object
plane as a plane wave and propagating the angular spectrum

-----------------Input---------------------
E1 =  the electromagnetic field right before propagation,
L = length of propagation in meters,
delta_image = Sample distance at the image plane,
wavelength = wavelength of the wave, set to be in the middle of the visible
spectrum,
refractive_index = The refractive index of the medium that the field will
be propagated through.

-----------------Output--------------------
E2 = The resulting electromagnetic field after propagation of the first
fields angular spectrum.

----------------Declared variables---------
N = size of matrix, global variable,
delta_k = sampling distance in the k plane at distance L,
k_x = A vector with all the sample positions in axial direction of kx,
k_y = Is equal to k_x to make the plane into a square form and so all
matrixes is the same size,
kx_matrix = Contains the x-components of the k vector in plane k,
ky_matrix = Contains the y-components of the k vector in plane k,
k_length = length of the k vector as function of wavelength and refractive
index,
kz_matrix = The z-component of the k vector for every plane wave in the k
plane,
phase_propagation = Every plane wave in the k plane is multiplied with this
as it propagates the length L,
Angular_spectrum_plane_1 = The angular spectrum of the plane wave in plane 1, the
object plane,
Angular_spectrum_plane_2 = The resulting angular spectrum in plane 2, often
image plane, after propagation of length L.

------------------Functions---------------
fft2c = fast fourier transform of the field and returns it as a complex
matrix,
ifft2c = inverse fast fourier transform of the angular spectrum and returns
it as a complex matrix.

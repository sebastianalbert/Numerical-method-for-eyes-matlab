# Numerical method for eyes in MATLAB

A numerical simulation of light propagation through the human eye with the help of fourier optics.
There are three different main files, one for each model of the eye. One is based on the Classical Emsley model,
one is based on the Gullstrand-Emsley model and the last one is based on the Exact Gullstrand model.

Each of the models are simulated by using Fourier optics as a method to propagate light through the different
mediums of the eye.
